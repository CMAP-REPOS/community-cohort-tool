# Community Cohort Evaluation Tool

This repository contains an [R](https://www.r-project.org) tool used by the [Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning](https://www.cmap.illinois.gov) to group the 284 municipalities and 77 Chicago Community Areas (CCAs) in the region into cohorts, which are then used to determine local contribution levels for [Local Technical Assistance](https://www.cmap.illinois.gov/programs/LTA) projects.
