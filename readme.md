# Cook County Equitable Distribution Model

This repository contains an R tool developed by the [Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning](https://www.cmap.illinois.gov) for Cook County to evaluate municipal eligibility for CARES Act funding based on a series of variables, with the aim of distributing the funding in an equitable manner. 

Below is the project structure, with notes about each file. The important files are shown in **bold**.

* `cook-equity-distribution-model.Rproj` -- RStudio project specification file
* **`cook_equity_distribution_model.R`** -- the tool
* `input/`
  * `cook_county_boundaries.geojson` -- Cook County boundary lines, for adding context to maps of results
  * `cmap_munis.geojson` -- municipality polygons for mapping results (heavily simplified, and only suitable for regionwide maps)
  * **`equity_distribution_inputs.xlsx`** -- spreadsheet containing *all* input data, weights and cohort score thresholds
* `output/`
  * **`assigned_scores_{SCENARIO}.csv`** -- municipal-level results generated by `cook_equity_distribution_model.R` reflecting multiple different factor-weighting scenarios
